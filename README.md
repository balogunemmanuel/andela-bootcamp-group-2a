Task: To write a code that outputs the Fibonacci sequence.

Introduction: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it, starting with 0 and 1. It can be shown as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth. This can easily be done if we are to go a few terms into the sequence, but for the sake of continuity, it will be coded using javascript, which enables the user to go as far as possible, by just stating the term needed.

The system gives an output in the form of an array, showing the sequence from 0, 1, up to the term specified. The initial numbers in the array will be 0, 1, and depending on the number (nth term) entered by the user, the system adds up the 2 previous numbers to give the next number.

There are comments in the code to help you have a clearer understanding of the process.
