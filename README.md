Task: To write a code that outputs the Fibonacci sequence.

Introduction: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it, starting with 0 and 1. It can be shown as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth. This can easily be done if we are to go a few terms into the sequence, but for the sake of continuity, it will be coded using javascript, which enables the user to go as far as possible, by just stating the term needed.

The output should be an array
The initial numbers in the array will be 0, 1.
How do you write a function that knows to add the last 2 numbers in an array and adds the result to the array?
